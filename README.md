Musica is a music streaming app I built with React Js


I built just the UI with few functionalities with the integration with spotify API the only missing thing
I ensured to maintain proper and easy to understand folder structure
I used props to pass data from components to components including images
I used React- Router for routing through the pages of this App.
I made use of Styled-components, Tailwind CSS and vanilla CSS and SCSS at different points of this App for the styling
I also made use of external libraries for the icons I used on this project
